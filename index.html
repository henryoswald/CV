                    I was not planning on applying for work until the summer however after seeing how you operate and what you do, especially how you really promote and practice XP I felt I needed to apply now. I have specialised in XP in my project management module and found it resonated with what I have found to be effective in develop**. While I have not formally pair programed I have recently practiced XP in group projects . Working in a open co-operative passionate environment like you offer is <em>extremely</em> important to me (pun intended).

                <p>
                    I am currently studding my MSc in Information Systems at Sheffield University, I came to become great at databases and had no real programing experience, 8 months later I found what I was meant to do, program, and am now top in the class <span class="quiet">(my course has a 5% distinction rate)</span>. I have only achieved this because I love programing and building things, I live inside Eclipse and Vim with Java is my bread and butter. My main web development experience has been using the impressive Java <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play!  Framework</a>, which exposed me to things like JUnit, Hibernate and the lovely world of MVC, but I still have a lot to learn. 
                </p>

                <p>I have learned far more than I expected in this degree; apart from Java and OO programming I have learned the basics of Intellectual Property rights, designing websites that are usable for everyone, how to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data">linked data</a> and much more. Perhaps the greatest surprise on this course has been the experiences of working in largely international teams on projects. How do I manage a fantastic Chinese developer who is too embarrassed to say she doesn't understand and so gets nothing done for 2 days? or a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time#South_Korea_and_Japan">stereotypical South Korean </a> who thinks hours == productivity when really fatigue means nothing gets done?</p>
        
                <p>
                    For my dissertation I managed to hunt down a tutor in the corner of the department who would let me do what I felt was valuable, so I am planning on building an online Latex editor written in <a href="http://nodejs.org/"> Node.js</a>, using  HTML5&apos;s <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/start-using-html5-websockets-today/">WebSockets</a> with <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> used for persistence. I chose these technologies because they are all very different to my current core strengths, Java and Relational Databases, but also would just like to learn and understand them.  </p>

                <p> 
                    I am happiest in UNIX machine and have found Mecurial to be my preferred VCS. I poke around everything I can when I have the time, from Amazon Web Services to the canvas element in HTML5 to SASS and writing little scripts in Python, I don&apos;t claim to be a master in any of these, but I am interested and always looking to learn more.
                </p>

                In my previous role at <a href="http://www.oswald.co.uk">Oswald Consultancy</a> and <a href="http://www.wattbox.com/Wattbox/Team.html"> Wattbox</a> I built systems mainly in <a href="http://www.filemaker.co.uk/">FileMaker</a>, where I was responsible for managing valuable sensitive data, including the UK&apos;s largest independent database on renewable energy. By then end of my time there I was building systems for other companies, including a student management system for a <a href="http://www.cava.ac.uk/"> Cambridge accreditation agency</a>, responsible for around 10 collages and 1500+ students a year. I was given complete control for that job from the initial pitch, negotiations, requirements analysis, 100% of the development to the final delivery and everything in between, even getting a <a href="recomendation.pdf">glowing recommendation </a> from the customer . This taught me a lot, especially about managing customers. I left purely because I had gone as far as I was able in these companies and felt I required further training. I still occasionally give them a hand from time to time.  </p>

                <p> 
                Outside of my IDE I am a very sociable guy; I have lived in other countries, as well as spending 6 months <a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/henryoswald/1/tpod.html">travelling solo</a> before starting the Masters. This also fed my other addition, food. I love to eat and cook everything. I play tennis, cycle and exercise regularly.

                <p>
                    I try and look ahead in a maximum of 18 months  rather than years as there are so many variables I find longer plans don't work. At this time all I want to do is continue to learn as much as possible and push myself with new challenges. I want to work with a team who are as passionate about development and building great things as I amd, Unruly Media is one of the few companies where I believe can realise this. I fit what you are looking for; Web Development is where I have been intentionally directing myself with every module choose as well as personal study; I have a strong foundation of good Java design and practices, I understand and want to work in an XP environment, I am a great communicator and a good problem solving guy to have in a team.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is a ridiculously brief snapshot into me and my world, however I have been on your side of this line a couple of years ago, wading through generic cover sheets, I know how smaller the margin can be between the bin and on the pile for review. Please give me a ring or <a href="mailto:henry.oswald@gmail.com">E-Mail</a> me with any questions or just for a 5 minute chat, I think I could really fit well into your company.
